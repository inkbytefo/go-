# GO-Minus Memory Management Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating the use of the Hybrid Smart Memory Management System for the GO-Minus programming language.

## Examples

### 1. Hybrid Memory Management

The [hybrid_memory_management.gom](hybrid_memory_management.gom) file demonstrates the use of GO-Minus's hybrid memory management features:

- Automatic memory management (garbage collection)
- Manual memory management
- Region-based memory management
- Memory pool templates
- Profile-based automatic optimization

```bash
gominus run hybrid_memory_management.gom
```

### 2. Lifetime Analysis

The [lifetime_analysis.gom](lifetime_analysis.gom) file demonstrates the use of GO-Minus's lifetime analysis feature:

- Memory leak detection
- Dangling pointer detection
- Safe reference management
- Lifetime scopes

```bash
gominus run lifetime_analysis.gom
```

## Memory Management Strategies

GO-Minus supports the following memory management strategies:

### 1. Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)

GO-Minus uses Go's garbage collector by default. This automates memory management, allowing programmers to write code without having to deal with common issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers.

### 2. Manual Memory Management

For performance-critical sections, GO-Minus offers a manual memory management option. This allows you to directly control memory allocation and deallocation operations within an `unsafe` block.

### 3. Region-Based Memory Management

GO-Minus's new feature, region-based memory management, allows programmers to mark certain code blocks as "memory regions" and automatically free all memory allocations in that region at the end of the block.

### 4. Lifetime Analysis

GO-Minus provides a lifetime analysis system inspired by Rust, but less strict. The compiler analyzes the lifetimes of variables and detects potential memory leaks or dangling pointers.

### 5. Profile-Based Automatic Optimization

GO-Minus provides a system that analyzes memory usage patterns while the application is running and automatically optimizes memory management in future runs.

### 6. Memory Pool Templates

GO-Minus provides templates that make it easier to create customized memory pools for specific data structures.
